This is the official repository of the R package SELECT - Selected Events Linked by Evolutionary Conditions across human Tumors - a methodology to infer evolutionary inter-dependencies between functional alterations in cancer.

### What is this repository for? ###

* SELECT is a package for inferring evolutionary dependencies between functional alterations in cancer starting from patterns of alteration occurrences in large tumor sample cohorts.
* Last Version: 1.6.3
